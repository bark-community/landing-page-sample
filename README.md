# BARK: Landing Page & Swap Monorepo

Integration

To create a BARK website for test purposes using Next.js, a popular React framework:

### Step 1: Set up the Next.js Project

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a Next.js App:**
   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app bark-website
   cd bark-website
   ```

### Step 2: Website Project Structure

1. **Create Components:**
   Inside the `components` folder, create React components for different parts of your website (e.g., Header, Footer, PostList, etc.).

2. **Pages:**
   Next.js uses the `pages` directory for routing. Create pages for different sections of your website (e.g., Home, Forum, About, Contact).

### Step 3: Styling

1. **CSS Modules:**
   Leverage CSS Modules for styling. Create a `styles` folder and use it to style your components.

### Step 4: Fetching Data

1. **API Routes:**
   Create API routes (inside the `pages/api` directory) to fetch data. For example, you might create an API route to fetch forum posts.

### Step 5: State Management

1. **Context API or Redux:**
   Depending on the complexity, you might use React Context API for state management. If your app grows, consider integrating Redux.

### Step 6: Implement Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   If your forum requires user authentication, implement it using NextAuth.js or another authentication solution.

2. **Forum Functionality:**
   Implement features like creating posts, commenting, upvoting/downvoting using the data fetched from your API routes.

### Step 7: Testing

1. **Unit Testing:**
   Write unit tests for your components and functions using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

### Step 8: Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   Next.js has seamless integration with Vercel. Sign up for a Vercel account and deploy your app with a few clicks.

### Step 9: Documentation

1. **Document Your Code:**
   Create documentation for your codebase, API routes, and how to run the project locally.

### Step 10: Continuous Integration (Optional)

1. **CI/CD:**
   Consider setting up continuous integration and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

### Step 11: SEO Optimization

1. **SEO:**
   Optimize your website for search engines. Use Next.js Head component for setting up meta tags.

### Step 12: Accessibility

1. **A11y:**
   Ensure your website is accessible. Follow best practices for accessibility.

### Step 13: Community Engagement

1. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   Integrate feedback mechanisms on the website and encourage the community to provide input.
